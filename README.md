***Unpaired Image2Image Translation

# CycleGAN

Tensorflow implementation for learning an image-to-image translation **without** input-output pairs.
The method is proposed by [Jun-Yan Zhu](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~junyanz/) in 
[Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networkssee](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf).
